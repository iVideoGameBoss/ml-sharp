## (PC ONLY) Transform Any 2D Video into a Cinematic 3D SBS Movie

**Unlock the full potential of your AR/VR hardware.** 
Don't just watch your movies—step inside them. With the new **SBS Movie Maker**, `ml-sharp` can ingest any standard 2D video file and reconstruct it into a stunning, depth-accurate Side-by-Side (SBS) 3D experience.

**Supported Hardware:**
Fully compatible with XREAL (Air/Air 2/Pro/Ultra/One), VITURE (Pro XR/One/Luma), Rokid (Max/Pro), RayNeo (Air 2/3S), Apple Vision Pro, Meta Quest, and any display that supports standard Side-by-Side content.

### How It Works: True Spatial Reconstruction
Unlike basic "2D-to-3D" converters that just shift pixels, `ml-sharp` uses Apple's cutting-edge SHARP architecture to perform a **full 3D reconstruction** of every single frame in your video:

1.  **AI Analysis:** The engine analyzes the footage frame-by-frame to understand geometry and depth.
2.  **Gaussian Splatting:** Each frame is converted into a metric 3D Gaussian Splat scene.
3.  **Stereoscopic Rendering:** Using a virtual dual-camera rig, we render two distinct perspectives (Left Eye and Right Eye) with mathematically correct parallax.
4.  **High-Fidelity Mastering:** The frames are stitched together and the original audio is remastered into the final container.

### Crystal Clear Resolution
We refuse to compromise on quality. Your output file is generated at a massive **3840x1080** resolution.
*   **Left Eye:** 1920x1080 (Full HD)
*   **Right Eye:** 1920x1080 (Full HD)

### Why It Always Works
The result is a standard `.mp4` file encoded in the industry-standard Side-by-Side (SBS) format. Because we bake the 3D effect directly into the video file, **it just works**.
*   **No special players required:** Play it in VLC, Windows Media Player, or directly inside your AR Glasses' native media player.
*   **Universal Compatibility:** If your device supports 3D SBS mode, this movie will play perfectly with full depth and immersion.

We present SHARP, an approach to photorealistic view synthesis from a single image. Given a single photograph, SHARP regresses the parameters of a 3D Gaussian representation of the depicted scene. This is done in less than a second on a standard GPU via a single feedforward pass through a neural network. The 3D Gaussian representation produced by SHARP can then be rendered in real time, yielding high-resolution photorealistic images for nearby views. The representation is metric, with absolute scale, supporting metric camera movements. Experimental results demonstrate that SHARP delivers robust zero-shot generalization across datasets. It sets a new state of the art on multiple datasets, reducing LPIPS by 25–34% and DISTS by 21–43% versus the best prior model, while lowering the synthesis time by three orders of magnitude.

## Getting started on MAC or PC

Installing ml-sharp is very easy and runs on any pc or mac. It can also run without GPU but works faster if you have it. We recommend to first create a python environment. For PC you must use python 3.10 on Mac it works fine with python 3.13

# Installing on PC
### Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.10** (Make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation)
- **Git**
Open up the CMD terminal and go to your root drive. in my example I just went to my d: drive

First clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/iVideoGameBoss/ml-sharp.git
```

Then go to ml-sharp folder
```
cd ml-sharp
```

Now create the venv environment. You must have python 3.10 installed on your PC
```
python.exe -m venv venv
```

Now activate the venv
```
cd venv
cd Scripts
activate
cd..
cd..
```

Now install the requirements.txt

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Now install the requirements-webui.txt

```
pip install -r requirements-webui.txt
```

Now install flask which is a lightweight websever

```
pip install flask
```

Now run this commend, Apple’s ml-sharp needs pip install -e . because it’s designed to be run directly from source while you’re actively developing and experimenting with it—not as a prebuilt, frozen library. 

```
pip install -e .
```

Now Install CUDA-Enabled PyTorch & GSplat (CRITICAL STEP)
We must install specific versions (PyTorch 2.4.0 + CUDA 12.1) to support the 3D renderer on Windows without Visual Studio.

```
pip uninstall -y torch torchvision torchaudio gsplat

pip install torch==2.4.0+cu121 torchvision==0.19.0+cu121 torchaudio==2.4.0+cu121 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121

pip install gsplat --index-url https://docs.gsplat.studio/whl/pt24cu121

```

Now Fix NumPy Version. Prevent crashes with newer NumPy versions.

```
pip install "numpy<2"
```

Now double click the bat file. For me it is in D:\ml-sharp\ cause thats where I cloned it.

This script is now configured to run in Isolated Mode, ensuring it uses the correct libraries we just installed and ignores any conflicting packages elsewhere on your system.

"D:\ml-sharp\run_webui.bat"

This batch file automatically prepares and starts the ml-sharp WebUI by first ensuring required dependencies like Flask are installed, then installing ml-sharp in editable (development) mode so Python always uses the live source code, and finally launching the web server with models preloaded and network access enabled; when you run it, the ML models load first, memory is allocated safely, and the web interface becomes available on port 7860 for your browser or other devices on the same network.

Thats it! Wait until server starts and is ready.

Open your browser and paste http://0.0.0.0:7860 or http://127.0.0.1:7860

# Installing on MAC

Install Homebrew

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

After install, follow the printed instructions to add Homebrew to your shell PATH (for zsh on macOS):

```
echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zshrc

eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"

```

To confirm:
```
brew --version
```

We’ll use Miniconda for environment isolation:
```
brew install --cask miniconda
```

Initialize Conda for your shell (zsh):
```
conda init zsh
exec $SHELL

```

Check Conda works:
```
conda --version
```

ml-sharp expects Python 3.10–3.13 (the repo uses ~3.10–3.13). Use a clean environment:
```
conda create -n mlsharp python=3.13 -y
conda activate mlsharp
```

You should now see (mlsharp) in your prompt.

Clone the ml-sharp source:

```
git clone https://github.com/iVideoGameBoss/ml-sharp.git
cd ml-sharp
```

Install Python dependencies using the requirements.txt file:
```
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-webui.txt
```

Verify installation:
```
sharp --help
```

Make the script executable
```
chmod +x run_webui.sh
```

Start the WebUI
```
./run_webui.sh
```

Wait until you see to open your browser to:
```
Http://localhost:7860
```

## Using the CLI

To run prediction:

```
sharp predict -i /path/to/input/images -o /path/to/output/gaussians
```

The model checkpoint will be downloaded automatically on first run and cached locally at `~/.cache/torch/hub/checkpoints/`.

Alternatively, you can download the model directly:

```
wget https://ml-site.cdn-apple.com/models/sharp/sharp_2572gikvuh.pt
```

To use a manually downloaded checkpoint, specify it with the `-c` flag:

```
sharp predict -i /path/to/input/images -o /path/to/output/gaussians -c sharp_2572gikvuh.pt
```

The results will be 3D gaussian splats (3DGS) in the output folder. The 3DGS `.ply` files are compatible to various public 3DGS renderers. We follow the OpenCV coordinate convention (x right, y down, z forward). The 3DGS scene center is roughly at (0, 0, +z). When dealing with 3rdparty renderers, please scale and rotate to re-center the scene accordingly.


### Running the WebUI on PC or Mac

1. Install the additional WebUI dependency on PC:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements-webui.txt
   ```

2. Start the WebUI server:

   **Windows:**
   ```
   run_webui.bat
   ```

   **Linux/Mac:**
   ```
   ./run_webui.sh
   ```

3. Open your browser to `http://localhost:7860`

The WebUI will be accessible from other devices on your network at `http://<your-ip>:7860`.

### Rendering trajectories (CUDA GPU only)

Additionally you can render videos with a camera trajectory. While the gaussians prediction works for all CPU, CUDA, and MPS, rendering videos via the `--render` option currently requires a CUDA GPU. The gsplat renderer takes a while to initialize at the first launch.

```
sharp predict -i /path/to/input/images -o /path/to/output/gaussians --render

# Or from the intermediate gaussians:
sharp render -i /path/to/output/gaussians -o /path/to/output/renderings
```
